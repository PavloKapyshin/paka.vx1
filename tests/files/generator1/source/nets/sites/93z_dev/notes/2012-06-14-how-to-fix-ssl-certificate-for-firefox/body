<p>Firefox requires intermediate SSL certificates while some other browsers donâ€™t. I use nginx, and all companies I work with use it too. Its <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_certificate">documentation</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>If intermediate certificates should be specified in addition to a primary certificate, they should be specified in the same file in the following order: the primary certificate comes first, then the intermediate certificates.</blockquote>

<p>This means that your certificate should look like this:</p>
<%note:code><%text>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
your certificate
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
intermediate certificate
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</%text></%note:code>
